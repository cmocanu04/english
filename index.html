    <h3>Storytelling</h3>
    
            <p>
                The world stands at a critical turning point. Nations across the globe are facing unprecedented challenges such as education, gender equality, health care, climate change and water scarcity. To shape a better future, the United Nations has created a new international initiative: The Global Assembly. 
                Each player represents a country, each with its own unique strengths and challenges. As world leaders, players will be invited to an international summit where they must make key decisions, respond to global crises, and collaborate—or compete—with others to push forward their national agenda while contributing to global progress. 
                From proposing climate policies to debating gender equality laws, players will face realistic and morally complex situational questions. The decisions made at the table can strengthen alliances as well as provoke tension. 
                Will you become a champion of change, a strategic negotiator, or a pragmatic realist? The fate of the world is in your hands.

    <h3>Why did we choose to develop this idea?</h3>
    
            <p>
                First, given that we are INSA students, we are aware of the contemporary challenges the world faces, and it is very important to us that everyone is open and aware of what is happening out of their everyday life. This game was made specifically for teenagers and students, to raise awareness so that the players could integrate those societal notions in their way of living and their work of tomorrow, but anyone who wants to learn about world issues is a good player.

                                                    Education is one of the most powerful tools for breaking the cycle of poverty and fostering sustainable development. It empowers individuals with knowledge, critical thinking, and the skills to build better lives for themselves and their communities. However, access to quality education is still unequal across the world. In many rural areas, especially in Sub-Saharan Africa or South Asia, children—particularly girls—are unable to attend school due to early marriage, household responsibilities, or the lack of basic facilities like sanitation. Without education, entire generations are left without the tools to escape poverty or contribute meaningfully to their societies.

                                                            Gender equality ensures that all people, regardless of gender, have the same rights, responsibilities, and opportunities. It is essential not only for justice but also for social and economic development. Despite advances in laws and awareness, women and gender minorities still face discrimination in areas such as employment, political representation, and education. For instance, women often earn less than men for the same work and are underrepresented in leadership positions, especially in science and technology. Achieving gender equality benefits everyone by creating more inclusive and dynamic communities.

In many low-income regions, hospitals lack basic supplies and staff, and millions of people cannot afford essential medicine or treatment. The COVID-19 pandemic revealed and deepened global health disparities, with vulnerable populations experiencing higher rates of infection and death due to limited access to care. Mental health, often neglected, is another critical part of well-being that remains underfunded and stigmatized in many societies.

                                                    Climate change is a growing global crisis caused by human activities such as burning fossil fuels, deforestation, and industrial pollution. It leads to rising temperatures, extreme weather events, and sea-level rise, which in turn impact agriculture, health, biodiversity, and human settlements. The 2023 wildfires in Canada and record-breaking heatwaves in Europe showed how climate change is no longer a distant threat but a present danger. Addressing it requires immediate action, international cooperation, and the transition to sustainable energy and lifestyles.

                                                    Water scarcity affects over 2 billion people globally, threatening agriculture, hygiene, and human survival. It can be due to physical shortages—like in arid regions—or economic barriers, such as the absence of water infrastructure. Climate change exacerbates this issue through prolonged droughts and erratic rainfall. Cape Town, South Africa, famously faced “Day Zero” in 2018, when the city nearly ran out of water entirely. Without secure access to clean water, communities cannot maintain health, grow food, or prevent disease, making water scarcity a root cause of many other social problems.

                                                    In the digital age, access to technology determines who can participate in education, work, and civic life. The digital divide separates those with reliable internet and digital tools from those without, often along economic or geographic lines. During the pandemic, this gap became painfully clear as millions of students in poor or rural areas were cut off from remote learning. Today, lacking digital access also means limited job opportunities, weaker social connections, and exclusion from essential services. Bridging this divide is essential for achieving equality in a technology-driven world.

                                                    Child labor deprives children of their right to education, safety, and a healthy childhood. Around the world, over 160 million children are still involved in labor—many of them in hazardous conditions. This exploitation is often driven by poverty and weak enforcement of labor laws. In West Africa, for example, children work long hours in cocoa plantations, often exposed to toxic chemicals and dangerous tools. Ending child labor requires both protecting children's rights and addressing the root causes like poverty and lack of access to schooling.

                                                    Climate change is increasingly forcing people to leave their homes due to floods, droughts, and rising sea levels—creating a new class of displaced persons known as climate refugees. Unlike traditional refugees, they have limited legal protection under international law, leaving them vulnerable to further exploitation and hardship. Communities in low-lying Pacific Island nations like Tuvalu are already planning for relocation, while drought-stricken regions in East Africa face growing migration pressures. Recognizing and addressing the needs of climate refugees is essential in adapting to the humanitarian consequences of environmental change.

                                                    Biodiversity refers to the variety of all living organisms—plants, animals, fungi, and microorganisms—that make up life on Earth. This diversity is essential for the health of ecosystems, climate stability, and human survival. However, human activities like deforestation, pollution, poaching, overfishing, and habitat destruction are causing species to go extinct at an alarming rate. According to the WWF, animal populations have declined by nearly 70% in the past 50 years. In addition to environmental impact, animal welfare is a major ethical concern, as billions of animals are exploited in industrial farming, laboratory testing, and the fashion industry, often under cruel conditions. Protecting biodiversity and ensuring the humane treatment of animals is vital—not only for environmental balance but also because humans are deeply interconnected with nature.

                    Dealing with situations related to these issues allows players to communicate and share opinions and eventually come up with one or more solution. This game highlights the importance of communication and balance, taking everyone’s point of view into account. By playing this game, players will learn about international issues they may have never heard of. 
                    By reflecting and discussing the proposed situations, the player is invited to think about his or her own actions and can motivate everyone to act or to donate in favour of associations that help people facing these issues.

                <ul>
                    <li>Each player is assigned to a country they are going to represent during the whole game  </li>

                <li>We have a spinning wheel that gives us the field the players are going to develop their country in. </li>
                    
                    <li>Once the field is given : each player has a card describing the problem in that field in their country  </li>
                    
                    <li>On the back of that same card there will be possible decisions they can make in order to solve the problem </li>
                    
                    <li>Each action leads to consequences : once they make a decision , they are given the consequences of that decision </li>  
                    
                    <li>Each consequence has a number of points they are either going to lose or going to gain. There are also points won and lost that are shared by all the countries. </li>
                    
                    <li>The winner is the one with the highest score, but the shared points must reach at least 20 points, or everybody loses. </li>
